## Installation

The core setup and source code for `chemtrain-deploy` are located in the [chemtrain-deploy](https://github.com/tummfm/chemtrain/tree/main/chemtrain-deploy) folder under [chemtrain repository](https://github.com/tummfm/chemtrain).
The code for MACE, Allegro, and PaiNN is adapted in `external/chemutils/models` under the MIT license.

First, install JAX with GPU support by following the [JAX Installation Instructions](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html).
Then, install the required packages for the project located in the `external` directory:

```bash
pip install -e "external/chemtrain[all]"
pip install -e "external/chemutils"
```

## Examples

Detailed usage examples can be found in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.  
We provide demonstrations for:

- Aluminum
- Solvated peptides
- Water slab
